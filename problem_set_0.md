Question 1: In your opinion what are the 3 most important factors of a 12 factor app?

1) Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost.********
2) Minimize differences between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility.
3) Can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.


Question 2: Restate the Core Values of DevSecOps in your own words?

For me, the core values represent the foundation to create a culture of automation, a culture of measurement and a culture of sharing. Leaders of organizations should remain in mind that this value are the foundation to change a way of thinking. Team should shared vision, goals, attitudes, values. The Agile foundation also promotes a culture of contiuous learning and move faster.


Question 3: Which of the 3 ways of DevSecOps do you think is the most difficult to implement? Explain why?

In my opinion the 3rd way. Cultural changes in organization are difficult to implement especially when the organization have been doing things for long time in a complete different way. The mind shift and the feeling of failure or the unknown refrain companies to support initiatives like this. 

Question 4: Why are we encouraged to treat our services as disposable?

Apps are self contained and should not injected into an external app server. They can be started or stopped at any moment of time. 


Question 5: Why is Dev Prod parity so important? What are some ways to acheive this?
Dev Prod parity is so important to avoid production incidentes caused by differences in enviroments configuration, setups, code etc. The production enviroment must mimic the same enviroment under the code was QA. Also, for troubleshooting purposes having unidentical enviroments will increase cost, time, quality and duration.
